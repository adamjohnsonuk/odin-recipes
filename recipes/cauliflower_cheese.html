        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everyone should know how to make cauliflower cheese. And don't stop at cauliflower! It's the perfect way to use up odds and ends of veg from the fridge too. Maybe add a small splash of white wine to the cheese sauce for a grown-up fondue flavour.</p>
        <p> You also use the green leaves from the cauliflower, becuase they are so delicious! </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium cauliflower, cut into florets, stem sliced and green outer leaves thickly shredded</li>
            <li>50g butter</li>
            <li>50g plain flour</li>
            <li>500ml milk</li>
            <li>120g mature Cheddar cheese, coarsely grated</li>
            <li>1 tsp English or Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>flaked sea salt and ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200C</li>
            <li>Half fill a large saucepan with water and bring to the boil. Add the florets, leaves and sliced stem for 4–5 minutes or until the florets are just tender when tested with the tip of knife. Drain in a colander and tip into a shallow baking dish.</li>
            <li>Put the butter, flour and milk in a medium saucepan. Whisk together with over a medium heat for 3–4 minutes, or until smooth and thick. Add roughly half of the grated cheese and the mustard. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly until the cheese melts. Add a splash more milk if the sauce thickens too much. Season with salt and pepper. Pour over the cooked cauliflower and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Place on a baking tray and bake for 20 minutes, or until lightly browned and bubbling. Serve.</li>
